# Sorry_game
This is the game, Sorry!, written in Python. This program was written, just for fun, to practice good coding practices and object-oriented design in Python. It uses the model/view/controller pattern, and it uses the Strategy Pattern, a behavioral software design pattern, for computer players' moves.

This classic family game can be played with 2, 3, or 4 players (one of which is human player). Just follow the directions on screen. The program uses the graphics.py library which can be downloaded from website: https://pypi.org/project/graphics.py/

To play run sorry_main.py.
