# Sorry_game
## Description
This is the game, Sorry!, written in Python. This program was written, just for fun, to practice good coding practices and object-oriented design in Python. It uses the model/view/controller pattern, and it uses the Strategy Pattern, a behavioral software design pattern, for computer players' moves.<br>
This classic family game can be played with 2, 3, or 4 players (one of which is human player). Played by clicking the screen: just follow the directions on screen!
## Features
* Over 10,000 lines of code, built from scratch
* Choice of 2, 3, or 4 players: color for human player chosen randomly
* Complex rules for moves: different moves for each different card type
* Creation or many different algorithms to handle complex rules, including splitting moves, forward/backward moves, and trading places
* Used object-oriented design techniques by creating different classes, e.g. game board, pieces, player_1, computer players, etc.
* Model/View/Controller Pattern used for structure of program
* Strategy Pattern used to simulate AI computer players' moves
* Point and click gameplay
* Utilized a graphics library for Python
* Animation of pieces, moving around the board
* Learned how to better utilize modular design as I progressed through the project, e.g. methods within methods
## Setup
The program uses the graphics.py library. To download, follow the instructions provided at this website: [https://pypi.org/project/graphics.py/](link)
## To Play
Download all Python files (or clone the repository). Run sorry_main.py.<br>
You will be prompted to choose how many players. Enjoy!
